Hello my name is Thomas -- a freelance data scientist based in Melbourne, Victoria.   
     
Previously, I worked as a senior data scientist at [OCTO Technology](https://octo.com/), a leading consulting firm in Paris.    
During my time there, I tackled a variety of data-driven challenges, from data engineering to machine learning, with a strong focus on generative AI in my later projects. Beyond technical expertise, I also honed my skills in cloud computing, project management, and the strategic deployment of AI solutions in businesses.    
     
Aside from my missions, I participated in the [Google Cloud x Mistral AI Hackathon](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/aitalla_google-cloud-and-mistral-ai-bootcamp-activity-7177091534503170048-EUj-?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABsqXTsBJhKPZFojYvLYo41bO3f4x-E1Or8) in Paris (March 2024), where my team was awarded a prize for our application. I also designed an [advanced training course on computer vision](https://www.octo.academy/catalogue/formation/cvtag-ia-computer-vision-traitements-analyses-generation-dimages-videos/) to help professionals deepen their expertise in image and video analysis.   

I believe that successfull data projects come from a balance of business acumen, technical excellence, and strong project execution.
